// great job, actualy the function getFileTree, is much important for the business of the library, much more important than being classed as a simple helper function, to achieve a better result, I think it should be great to create a new class called, FileTree, that toke the same parameter of the function, and based on it it generate a complete tree of the pattern give it, can you help me on his implementation please

// on data structure view then, a FileTree, has to manage n Directory object and n File object, and off-course, every Directory object has n File object

// the FileTree class has to manage the bundle method, that has to be called on the root Directory object, and this method has to be called recursively on all Directory objects
